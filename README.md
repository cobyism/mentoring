# Mentoring

Inspired by [a distributed mentoring movement](https://github.com/dianakimball/mentoring), this repo gives you a [/mentoring](http://cobyism.com/mentoring) page which you can customise to suit your own needs.

### How do I do this?

- Fork the [cobyism/mentoring](https://github.com/cobyism/mentoring) repository here on GitHub.
- Your page will be published at `yourname.github.com/mentoring` using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).
- Link to your mentoring page from your websites and online profiles.
