          <p class='intro'>I believe that direct connections between real people are&nbsp;transformative, no matter how brief, humble, or&nbsp;insignificant they sometimes&nbsp;appear.</p>

          <p>Without the people who have guided, supported, questioned, and encouraged me along the way, many of the experiences I deeply treasure would simply not have happened, and I would not be who I am today. Because of this, it’s important to me that I pay it forward, so I’d like to make myself available in a mentoring capacity to anyone who genuinely believes they would benefit from sharing my feedback, advice, experiences, or guidance.</p>

          <p>I don’t profess to be the world’s best example to follow in any respect, however I’m lucky enough to have had an number of incredible opportunities and experiences come my way.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>I made the switch from full-time IT manager to full-time freelance web developer, which I did for about 7 years.</li>
            <li>While self-employed I worked for clients both locally and overseas, and completed a university degree in IT security.</li>
            <li>In 2012 I got hired for my dream job working remotely for <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, a company that produces web-based collaboration tools for people who build software.</li>
            <li>I’ve twice moved my entire life to a new country, and have travelled to some pretty interesting places.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you’d like to work together, you can write me a letter responding to the questions below; I’ll write back to all letters I receive in this way within two weeks, no matter what. In response to the most exceptional letters, I’ll propose further correspondence—and in certain cases, an ongoing mentoring relationship.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Tell me about yourself. What do you do? What are your goals?</li>
            <li>What do you hope to gain from our mentoring relationship?</li>
            <li>What’s the most interesting thing you’ve come across to lately?</li>
            <li>What’s the achievement you’re most proud of so far in whatever it is you do?</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Add links to any profiles or projects you’re proud of, and <a href="mailto:coby@github.com">send it to me</a>.</p>

          <p class="sign-out">I look forward to learning together.</p>
